FADE IN:

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A cozy, dimly lit coffee shop. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee fills the air. SARAH, 28, sits alone at a corner table, typing furiously on her laptop. She's dressed in business casual attire, clearly working.

SARAH
(typing, muttering to herself)
Come on, come on... deadline is in two hours...

The door chimes as ALEX, 30, enters. He's disheveled but handsome, carrying a worn leather satchel. He looks around, spots an empty table near Sarah.

ALEX
(to the barista)
Large black coffee, please. Extra strong.

BARISTA
Coming right up.

Alex sits at the table next to Sarah. He notices her intense focus and smiles slightly.

ALEX
(softly)
Working on something important?

Sarah looks up, startled. She hadn't noticed him sit down.

SARAH
Oh! Sorry, I was in the zone. Yeah, big presentation due soon.

ALEX
I can see the concentration. Your forehead is doing that thing.

SARAH
What thing?

ALEX
The thing where it wrinkles up like you're solving world peace.

Sarah laughs, some of her tension easing.

SARAH
Is it that obvious?

ALEX
Only to someone who's been there. What's the presentation about?

SARAH
Marketing strategy for a new product launch. It's make-or-break for our company.

ALEX
Sounds intense. Want to bounce some ideas off me? Sometimes a fresh perspective helps.

Sarah considers this for a moment.

SARAH
Actually... that might be exactly what I need. I've been staring at this screen for so long, I can't see straight anymore.

ALEX
Perfect timing then. I'm Alex, by the way.

SARAH
Sarah. And I'm grateful for the distraction.

They share a warm smile as the barista brings Alex's coffee.

FADE OUT.
