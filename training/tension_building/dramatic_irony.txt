I think I know who killed my father.

Who?

His business partner, Robert Chen.

MARTINEZ
(beat)
Sarah... Robert Chen died in a car accident last year.

SARAH
(confused)
What? No, that's impossible.

MARTINEZ
I investigated the accident myself.
He was driving drunk, hit a tree.

SARAH
(realizing)
Then who... who have I been following?

MARTINEZ
(concerned)
What do you mean, following?

Sarah's face goes pale.

SARAH
I've been watching someone I thought was Chen.
Taking photos, following him...

MARTINEZ
Sarah, you need to stop.
You could be putting yourself in danger.

SARAH
(whispering)
I thought I was getting revenge.
But I was just... stalking a stranger.
