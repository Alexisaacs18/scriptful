Example Suspense Scene:
INT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT
Sarah walks down the narrow passage, footsteps echoing.

She hears something behind her. Stops. Listens.

Silence.

Sarah continues walking, but faster now.

Another sound. Closer this time.

She reaches for her phone, dials 911.

SARAH
(whispering)
Come on, come on...

The line rings. And rings.

Sarah looks back. Sees movement in the shadows.

SARAH
(panicked)
Hello? I need help!

OPERATOR (V.O.)
911, what's your emergency?

SARAH
I'm being followed. I'm in--

A HAND clamps over her mouth.

Sarah struggles, drops the phone.

OPERATOR (V.O.)
Ma'am? Ma'am, are you there?

The phone is kicked away.

Sarah's eyes widen in terror.
