EMOTIONAL MONOLOGUES IN SCREENPLAYS

Key Techniques:
1. Internal vs External Expression
   - Internal: Character's thoughts and feelings
   - External: Character's actions and reactions

2. Emotional Pacing
   - Start subtle, build to climax
   - Use pauses and beats for impact
   - Vary emotional intensity

3. Character Voice
   - Each character should have distinct speech patterns
   - Reflect their background and personality
   - Show emotional state through word choice

Example Structure:
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
Sarah sits on the edge of the bed, staring at the phone.

SARAH
(quietly, to herself)
I thought I knew what love was.
(beat)
But this... this is different.
(voice cracks)
This hurts so much more.

She picks up the phone, dials a number, then hangs up.

SARAH
(whispering)
Why can't I just let go?
