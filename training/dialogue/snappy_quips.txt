SNAPPY DIALOGUE TECHNIQUES
==========================

FILM EXAMPLES:
- "Die Hard" (1988) - John McClane's one-liners
- "The Princess Bride" (1987) - Westley's witty responses
- "Pulp Fiction" (1994) - Jules and Vincent's banter

TECHNIQUE ANALYSIS:
1. Timing: Deliver quips at moments of tension or victory
2. Character Voice: Each character has distinct speech patterns
3. Context Awareness: Quips relate to the immediate situation
4. Brevity: Keep responses short and punchy
5. Personality: Reflect the character's background and attitude

EXAMPLE EXCHANGES:
"Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker!" - Die Hard
"Have fun storming the castle!" - The Princess Bride
"Say 'what' again. I dare you." - Pulp Fiction

IMPLEMENTATION TIPS:
- Use quips to release tension
- Make them character-specific
- Keep them relevant to the scene
- Don't overuse - save for key moments
