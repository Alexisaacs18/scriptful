PULP FICTION - THE DINER SCENE
(End of the movie - Jules and Vincent's philosophical discussion)

JULES
You know what the funniest thing about Europe is?

VINCENT
What?

JULES
It's the little differences. I mean, they got the same shit over there that they got here, but it's just there it's a little different.

VINCENT
Example?

JULES
Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer at a movie theater. And I don't mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer. And in Paris, you can buy beer at McDonald's.

VINCENT
You know what the funniest thing about America is?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
It's the little differences. I mean, they got the same shit over here that they got over there, but it's just here it's a little different.

JULES
Example?

VINCENT
Well, in America, you can buy a fucking good cup of coffee. And in America, you can buy a fucking good hamburger.

JULES
You got that right.

PULP FICTION - ROYALE WITH CHEESE SCENE

JULES
You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?

VINCENT
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?

JULES
No, they got the metric system there. They wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.

VINCENT
What do they call it?

JULES
They call it a "Royale with Cheese."

VINCENT
"Royale with Cheese." What do they call a Big Mac?

JULES
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it "Le Big Mac."

VINCENT
"Le Big Mac." What do they call a Whopper?

JULES
I don't know, I didn't go into Burger King.

PULP FICTION - THE FOOT MASSAGE SCENE

JULES
You know, I'm getting kinda tired. I could use a foot massage myself.

Man, you don't be givin' me that foot massage shit again. I done told you, that shit don't fly in this car.

I'm just sayin', it'd be nice to get a foot massage by a beautiful woman with a sexy voice.

INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS - THE OPENING FARMHOUSE SCENE

COLONEL LANDA
You know, Monsieur Lapadite, I've been thinking about this farm of yours. It's quite beautiful.

LAPADITE
Thank you.

LANDA
And I've been thinking about the people who live here. The people who work here. The people who... hide here.

A beat. Lapadite's hands begin to shake.

LANDA
You see, Monsieur Lapadite, I have a theory about people. I believe that people are like rats. They're everywhere, they're dirty, they're... they're vermin.

LAPADITE
I... I don't understand.

LANDA
But rats, Monsieur Lapadite, they have one thing that makes them special. They have... survival instincts. They know when to hide, when to run, when to... disappear.

INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS - THE STRUDEL SCENE

COLONEL LANDA
You know, Shosanna, I think this might be my masterpiece.

Your masterpiece?

Yes. You see, I have a weakness for sweets. And this strudel is absolutely perfect.

SHOSANNA
I'm glad you like it.

LANDA
I don't like it, Shosanna. I love it. I love it so much, I could eat it every day for the rest of my life.

SHOSANNA
That's very kind of you to say.

LANDA
No, it's not kind. It's honest. There's a difference.

THE BRIDE
(voice over)
When I wake up tomorrow, I will be 28 years old. And I will have been a killer for 10 years. And in those 10 years, I have killed a lot of people. And I have killed them in a lot of different ways. But I have never killed anyone in cold blood. Until now.

KILL BILL VOL. 2 - THE SUPERMAN SPEECH

BILL
You know, I've always liked that word... "gratitude." It's a quality I like in a man. And I'm gonna give you a little something, you can't have, and no one else can have. Just you. Just you.

THE BRIDE
What?

BILL
Gratitude.

THE BRIDE
Gratitude?

BILL
Yeah, gratitude. You see, gratitude is a quality I like in a man. And I'm gonna give you a little something, you can't have, and no one else can have. Just you. Just you.

RESERVOIR DOGS - THE TIP SCENE

MR. PINK
I don't tip because society says I have to. All right, I mean I'll tip if someone really deserves a tip. If they put forth an effort, I'll give them something extra. But I mean, this tipping automatically, it's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doing their job.

MR. BLUE
Hey, this isn't a tip. This is a bribe.

MR. PINK
What's the difference?

MR. BLUE
A tip is something you give to someone who's done something for you. A bribe is something you give to someone so they'll do something for you.

JACKIE BROWN - THE COFFEE SCENE

JACKIE
You know what I do when I get depressed?

MAX
What?

JACKIE
I go to the movies. I go to the movies and I sit in the dark and I watch the screen and I forget about everything else.

MAX
That's not a bad idea.

JACKIE
Yeah, it works for me. You should try it sometime.

MAX
Maybe I will.

JACKIE
Yeah, you should. It's cheaper than therapy.

You know, Django, I've been thinking about something.

What's that?

DR. SCHULTZ
Well, you see, I'm a bounty hunter. And bounty hunters are not welcome in most establishments. But you know what I've found?

DJANGO
What?

DR. SCHULTZ
That if you're polite and you're respectful, people will usually let you in. And if they don't, well, then you just have to be more... persuasive.

DJANGO
I see.

DR. SCHULTZ
Yes. You see, Django, the key to success in this world is to be polite, but to have a plan to kill everyone you meet.
