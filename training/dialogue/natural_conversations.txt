NATURAL CONVERSATIONS IN SCREENPLAYS

Core Principles:
1. Realistic Speech Patterns
   - People interrupt each other
   - Conversations have natural flow
   - Include filler words and pauses
   - Show thinking through speech

2. Subtext and Implication
   - What characters say vs. what they mean
   - Hidden agendas and motivations
   - Emotional undercurrents
   - Power dynamics in conversation

3. Character-Specific Language
   - Education level and background
   - Regional dialects and slang
   - Age-appropriate speech
   - Personality-driven communication style

Example of Natural Flow:
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
Mike and Lisa sit across from each other.

MIKE
So, uh... how's work been?

LISA
(not looking up from phone)
Fine.

MIKE
Just... fine?

LISA
(sighs, puts phone down)
What do you want me to say, Mike?

MIKE
I don't know, maybe... how you're actually doing?

LISA
(beat)
I'm tired. Is that what you want to hear?

MIKE
I want to hear whatever you want to tell me.

LISA
(softening)
I'm sorry. I'm just... stressed.
