GOOD WILL HUNTING
Written by Matt Damon & Ben Affleck

FADE IN:

INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY

A warm, book-lined office. SEAN MAGUIRE (50s) - a community college professor and therapist - sits across from WILL HUNTING (20s) - a brilliant but troubled young man. The tension between them is electric.

SEAN
So, what do you want to do with your life?

WILL
(smugly)
I don't know. Maybe be a shepherd.

SEAN
A shepherd?

WILL
Yeah, you know. Get a flock of sheep, move them around. Seems peaceful.

SEAN
(leaning forward)
You think you're the first person to ever feel this way? You think you're the first person to ever have this much pain?

WILL
(defensive)
I don't know what you're talking about.

SEAN
(standing, walking to his desk)
You know what I'm talking about. You're scared. You're scared to death of what you might become.

WILL
I'm not scared of anything.

SEAN
(grabbing a photo)
You see this? This is my wife. She died two years ago.

Will looks at the photo, his bravado faltering.

SEAN
(continuing)
She was the love of my life. And when she died, I thought I'd never love again. But then I realized something.

WILL
What's that?

SEAN
That love is worth the pain. That opening yourself up to someone, really opening yourself up, that's what life is about.

WILL
(quietly)
I don't know how to do that.

SEAN
(sitting back down)
You do. You just have to let yourself. You have to trust that someone will catch you when you fall.

A beat. Will's eyes are wet with unshed tears.

SEAN
(continuing)
You know what I see when I look at you? I see a kid who's afraid to let anyone in. A kid who thinks he has to do everything alone.

WILL
Maybe I do.

SEAN
No, you don't. None of us do. That's the point of being human.

Will looks down at his hands, his tough exterior finally cracking.

WILL
(voice over)
I never thought anyone would understand. I never thought anyone would see me for who I really am.

SEAN
(softly)
I see you, Will. I see you.

FADE OUT.
