INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS
Written by Quentin Tarantino

FADE IN:

INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

A rustic French farmhouse. COLONEL HANS LANDA (40s) - the "Jew Hunter" - sits across from PERRIER LAPADITE (50s), a dairy farmer. The tension is palpable. Landa's smile is charming, but his eyes are calculating.

LANDA
(cheerfully)
I love this country. I love this country so much, I'm going to make it my own.

LAPADITE
(uneasy)
That's... that's very kind of you, Colonel.

LANDA
(leaning forward)
You know, Monsieur Lapadite, I've been thinking about this farm of yours. It's quite beautiful.

LAPADITE
Thank you.

LANDA
And I've been thinking about the people who live here. The people who work here. The people who... hide here.

A beat. Lapadite's hands begin to shake.

LANDA
(continuing)
You see, Monsieur Lapadite, I have a theory about people. I believe that people are like rats. They're everywhere, they're dirty, they're... they're vermin.

LAPADITE
I... I don't understand.

LANDA
(standing, walking around the table)
But rats, Monsieur Lapadite, they have one thing that makes them special. They have... survival instincts. They know when to hide, when to run, when to... disappear.

Lapadite watches as Landa circles him like a predator.

LANDA
(continuing)
Now, I'm not saying that the people hiding under your floorboards are rats. I'm just saying that they have the same survival instincts.

LAPADITE
(panicking)
I don't know what you're talking about!

LANDA
(stopping behind him)
Don't you?

The camera slowly pans down to reveal the wooden floorboards. We can hear the faint sound of breathing underneath.

LANDA
(voice over)
You see, Monsieur Lapadite, I have a job to do. And I'm very good at my job.

FADE OUT.

This sample captures the intense psychological warfare, masterful dialogue, and building tension that defines "Inglourious Basterds" - a film where words are weapons and every conversation is a battle of wits.
