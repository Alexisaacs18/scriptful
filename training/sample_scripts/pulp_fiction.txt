PULP FICTION
Written by Quentin Tarantino

FADE IN:

INT. DINER - DAY

A classic 50s-style diner. JULES WINNFIELD (30s) and VINCENT VEGA (30s) - two hitmen in suits - sit in a booth. They're having a casual conversation about foot massages and the meaning of life.

JULES
You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?

VINCENT
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?

JULES
No, they got the metric system there. They wouldn't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.

VINCENT
What do they call it?

JULES
They call it a "Royale with Cheese."

VINCENT
"Royale with Cheese." What do they call a Big Mac?

JULES
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it "Le Big Mac."

VINCENT
"Le Big Mac." What do they call a Whopper?

JULES
I don't know, I didn't go into Burger King.

A beat. They both laugh.

JULES
(continuing)
But you know what's on a Big Mac? Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame seed bun.

VINCENT
That's a Big Mac.

JULES
That's a Big Mac.

VINCENT
What's on a Whopper?

JULES
I don't know, I didn't go into Burger King.

They laugh again. The camera pulls back to reveal they're in a diner, and this is just two guys having breakfast.

JULES
(voice over)
You know what the funniest thing about Europe is?

VINCENT
What?

JULES
It's the little differences. I mean, they got the same shit over there that they got here, but it's just there it's a little different.

VINCENT
Example?

JULES
Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer at a movie theater. And I don't mean in a paper cup either. They give you a glass of beer. And in Paris, you can buy beer at McDonald's.

VINCENT
You know what the funniest thing about America is?

JULES
What?

VINCENT
It's the little differences. I mean, they got the same shit over here that they got over there, but it's just here it's a little different.

JULES
Example?

VINCENT
Well, in America, you can buy a fucking good cup of coffee. And in America, you can buy a fucking good hamburger.

JULES
You got that right.

FADE OUT.
