THE GENTLEMAN
Written by Guy Ritchie

FADE IN:

EXT. LONDON - DAY

A sleek black Bentley glides through the rain-slicked streets of Mayfair. Inside, MICKEY PEARSON (50s) - impeccably dressed, exudes quiet menace. He's a man who's built an empire on other people's vices.

MICKEY
(voice over)
I've always been a businessman. The fact that my business happens to be drugs is purely incidental.

INT. EXCLUSIVE GENTLEMEN'S CLUB - DAY

Mickey sits across from FREDDIE (40s), a nervous accountant type. The club is all dark wood and leather, the air thick with cigar smoke and old money.

MICKEY
You see, Freddie, the problem with your proposal is that it lacks... subtlety.

FREDDIE
(swallowing hard)
I understand the risks, Mr. Pearson.

MICKEY
Do you? Because what I'm hearing is a man who thinks he can walk into my world and play by his own rules.

A beat. Freddie's hand trembles as he reaches for his drink.

MICKEY
(continuing)
My world has rules, Freddie. Unwritten, but absolute. Break them, and you'll find yourself in a very dark place indeed.

INT. MICKEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Mickey stands at the window, looking out over London. His phone rings.

MICKEY
(answering)
Pearson.

RAY (V.O.)
Mickey, we have a situation.

MICKEY
What kind of situation?

RAY (V.O.)
The kind that requires your personal attention.

MICKEY
I'll be there in twenty minutes.

He hangs up, grabs his coat. The camera lingers on his reflection in the window - a man who's about to face the consequences of his choices.

FADE OUT.

This sample captures the sophisticated tone, sharp dialogue, and atmospheric tension that defines "The Gentleman" - a film about power, loyalty, and the high stakes of the criminal underworld.
