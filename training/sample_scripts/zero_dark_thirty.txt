ZERO DARK THIRTY
Written by Mark Boal

FADE IN:

INT. CIA INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

A stark, windowless room. MAYA (30s) - a CIA intelligence analyst - watches through a one-way mirror as DAN (40s) interrogates a detainee. The room is cold, clinical, and filled with the weight of what's about to happen.

MAYA
(voice over)
I've been hunting him for ten years. Ten years of dead ends, false leads, and broken promises.

DAN
(calmly)
You know why you're here, don't you?

DETAINEE
(terrified)
I don't know anything!

DAN
(leaning forward)
I think you do. I think you know exactly where he is.

The detainee's eyes dart around the room, looking for escape. There is none.

MAYA
(voice over)
Some people think torture doesn't work. They're wrong. It works. But it also changes you.

DAN
(continuing)
You have a choice. You can tell us what we want to know, or we can make this very unpleasant.

DETAINEE
(panicking)
I swear, I don't know!

DAN
(standing)
Then we'll have to find another way to make you remember.

Maya watches as Dan begins his work. Her face is impassive, but her eyes betray the cost of what she's doing.

MAYA
(voice over)
Every day, I ask myself the same question. Is it worth it? Is he worth it?

INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

Maya sits alone in her office, surrounded by maps, photos, and intelligence reports. The walls are covered with timelines, connections, and theories. She's been here for hours.

MAYA
(voice over)
I've given up everything for this. My life, my relationships, my humanity. All for one man.

Her phone rings. It's her boss.

BOSS (V.O.)
Maya, we have something. A courier. He's been spotted in Pakistan.

MAYA
(standing)
When?

BOSS (V.O.)
Two hours ago. We're tracking him now.

MAYA
(grabbing her coat)
I'm on my way.

She rushes out the door, but stops to look back at her office. The walls seem to close in around her.

MAYA
(voice over)
This is it. After ten years, this is finally it.

FADE OUT.

This sample captures the intense procedural nature, moral ambiguity, and psychological complexity that defines "Zero Dark Thirty" - a film about the cost of justice and the price of obsession.
