SICARIO
Written by Taylor Sheridan

FADE IN:

EXT. EL PASO BORDER - DAWN

The sun rises over the desert landscape. A convoy of black SUVs moves like shadows across the border. Inside the lead vehicle, KATE MACER (30s) - an idealistic FBI agent - sits with ALEJANDRO (40s), a mysterious Colombian consultant. The tension is thick.

KATE
(voice over)
I joined the FBI to make a difference. To protect people. But out here, the rules are different.

ALEJANDRO
(quietly)
You think you know what you're getting into, Agent Macer?

KATE
I know enough.

ALEJANDRO
(smiling darkly)
No. You don't.

INT. MEXICAN CARTEL HOUSE - DAY

The team breaches a house. The camera follows Kate through the chaos - gunfire, shouting, the sound of boots on concrete. She moves with precision, but her eyes betray her uncertainty.

KATE
(radio)
Clear! Room clear!

Suddenly, a door bursts open. A young boy, no more than 12, stands there with a gun. Kate freezes. The boy's hand trembles.

KATE
(softly)
Put it down. Please.

The boy doesn't move. His eyes are empty, dead. Alejandro appears behind him, silent as death.

ALEJANDRO
(whispering)
This is what you signed up for, Agent Macer. This is the real world.

The boy's finger twitches on the trigger. Kate's gun is steady, but her soul is breaking.

KATE
(voice over)
Sometimes the only way to stop evil is to become evil yourself.

FADE OUT.
