Example Rapid Sequence:
INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
Sarah runs through the dark space, footsteps echoing.

BULLET RICOCHETS off metal nearby.

Sarah ducks behind a crate. Heavy footsteps approach.

SARAH
(whispering)
Come on, come on...

She spots an exit sign. 20 feet away.

SARAH
(breathing hard)
Twenty feet. I can make it.

She takes a deep breath, then SPRINTS.

BULLETS FLY past her as she runs.

Sarah reaches the door, slams it open--

--and runs straight into ARMED MEN.

SARAH
Oh shit.

She spins, runs back inside--

--right into the pursuing gunman.

SARAH
(desperate)
Wait! I can explain!

GUNMAN
(raising weapon)
Explain this.

Sarah's eyes dart around. Sees a fire extinguisher.

SARAH
(quick thinking)
That!

She points behind him. He turns--

Sarah GRABS the extinguisher, SPRAYS him in the face.

GUNMAN
(blinded)
Ah! My eyes!

Sarah RUNS past him, out the door.
