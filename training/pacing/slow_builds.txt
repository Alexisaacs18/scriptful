SLOW BUILD PACING TECHNIQUES
============================

FILM EXAMPLES:
- "Jaws" (1975) - Gradual shark threat escalation
- "The Shining" (1980) - Psychological tension building
- "No Country for Old Men" (2007) - Methodical chase progression

TECHNIQUE ANALYSIS:
1. Gradual Escalation: Increase stakes incrementally
2. Information Drip: Reveal details slowly over time
3. Character Development: Use slower pace for relationship building
4. Atmospheric Building: Create mood and tension gradually
5. Anticipation: Make the audience wait for payoff

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
- Start with small, seemingly unrelated events
- Build connections between scenes gradually
- Use dialogue to reveal character motivations
- Create false sense of security
- Increase tension through visual and audio cues

PACING STRUCTURE:
1. Setup: Establish normalcy and characters
2. Inciting Incident: Introduce the central conflict
3. Gradual Escalation: Small complications build up
4. Rising Action: Stakes increase more rapidly
5. Climax: All built-up tension releases

KEY PRINCIPLES:
- Every scene should advance the story
- Use quiet moments to build anticipation
- Balance action with character development
- Make the audience care before raising stakes
- The payoff should justify the build-up
