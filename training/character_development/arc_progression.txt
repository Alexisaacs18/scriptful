CHARACTER ARC PROGRESSION TECHNIQUES
====================================

FILM EXAMPLES:
- "Rocky" (1976) - From underdog to champion
- "The Godfather" (1972) - Michael's transformation
- "Casablanca" (1942) - Rick's redemption arc

TECHNIQUE ANALYSIS:
1. Starting Point: Establish character's initial state/flaws
2. Inciting Incident: Event that forces change
3. Resistance: Character fights against transformation
4. Midpoint: Major realization or decision point
5. Crisis: Lowest point that forces change
6. Climax: Character acts on their transformation
7. Resolution: New character state is demonstrated

ARC TYPES:
- Positive Arc: Character grows/improves
- Negative Arc: Character deteriorates
- Flat Arc: Character changes the world around them
- Corrupted Arc: Character becomes worse

IMPLEMENTATION TIPS:
- Make the arc meaningful to the plot
- Show internal and external conflicts
- Use dialogue to reveal character growth
- Demonstrate change through actions, not just words
- Ensure the arc serves the story's theme

EXAMPLE PROGRESSION:
1. Act 1: Character in comfort zone
2. Act 2A: Character resists change
3. Act 2B: Character begins to change
4. Act 3: Character fully transformed

KEY PRINCIPLES:
- Change should be earned, not given
- Character flaws should relate to the plot
- Transformation should affect other characters
- The arc should have emotional weight
