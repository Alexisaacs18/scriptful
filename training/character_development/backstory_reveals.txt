Example Backstory Reveal:
INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Sarah sits alone, looking at old photographs.

SARAH
(voice over)
I was twelve when my father left.

She picks up a photo of a young girl with her father.

SARAH
(voice over)
He said he was going to get milk.
Never came back.

Sarah opens a drawer, revealing a stack of letters.

SARAH
(voice over)
I found these years later.
He'd been writing to me every month.

She reads from one letter.

SARAH
(voice over)
"Dear Sarah, I'm sorry I left.
I was scared. I'm still scared."

Sarah's phone rings. She doesn't answer.

SARAH
(voice over)
Now I'm the one who's scared.
Scared of becoming him.

Techniques for Effective Backstory Reveals:
- Reveal only what's necessary for the story
- Use backstory to explain current behavior
- Make revelations emotionally impactful
- Connect backstory to character goals
- Show, don't tell, when possible

Common Pitfalls:
- Revealing too much too soon
- Backstory that doesn't affect the present
- Exposition dumps and info dumps
- Backstory that contradicts character actions
- Forgetting to show character reactions

Remember: Backstory should illuminate the present, not replace it.
