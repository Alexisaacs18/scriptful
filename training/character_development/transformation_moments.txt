Example Transformation Scene:
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
Sarah sits by her father's bedside, holding his hand.

SARAH
(whispering)
I'm sorry, Dad. I've been so angry.

Her father's breathing is labored.

SARAH
I thought you abandoned us.
But you were just scared.

She looks at her father's face, seeing him differently.

SARAH
I understand now. Fear makes us do things...
things we regret.

Sarah's phone buzzes. It's her boss.

SARAH
(answering)
I need to take some time off.

BOSS (V.O.)
Sarah, this project is critical--

SARAH
(interrupting)
I know. But my father is dying.
And I need to be here.

BOSS (V.O.)
(beat)
Take all the time you need.

Sarah hangs up, looks at her father.

SARAH
I'm not going to let fear control me anymore.
I'm going to be brave. For both of us.
