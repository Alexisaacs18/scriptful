Example Surprise Ending Setup:
Throughout the story, subtle clues about the protagonist's true nature:

EARLY SCENE - HINT:
INT. OFFICE - DAY
Sarah adjusts her tie, looking uncomfortable.

COLLEAGUE
You know, you're the most honest person I've met.

SARAH
(smiling)
I try to be.

COLLEAGUE
It's refreshing. Most people lie about everything.

Sarah's smile falters slightly.

LATER SCENE - BUILDING SUSPICION:
INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
Sarah practices expressions in the mirror.

SARAH
(to herself)
I need to be more convincing.

FINAL REVELATION:
INT. COURTROOM - DAY
Sarah stands before the judge.

JUDGE
Sarah Johnson, you've been found guilty of perjury.
You've lied under oath in seventeen separate cases.

SARAH
(calmly)
I know.

JUDGE
Why? Why would you do this?

SARAH
(smiling)
Because I'm the best liar you've ever met.
And I wanted to prove it.
