MISDIRECTION PLOT TWIST TECHNIQUES
==================================

FILM EXAMPLES:
- "The Sixth Sense" (1999) - Bruce Willis revelation
- "Fight Club" (1999) - Tyler Durden twist
- "The Usual Suspects" (1995) - Keyser Soze reveal

TECHNIQUE ANALYSIS:
1. Red Herrings: Plant false clues that seem important
2. Perspective Manipulation: Show events from misleading viewpoints
3. Selective Information: Withhold key details until the reveal
4. Character Deception: Make characters lie or mislead
5. Timeline Manipulation: Present events out of chronological order

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES:
- Plant clues that seem to point one way
- Use unreliable narrators
- Create false assumptions in the audience
- Make the twist logical in hindsight
- Ensure the reveal changes everything

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
1. Setup: Establish apparent reality
2. Development: Build on false assumptions
3. Misdirection: Reinforce wrong conclusions
4. Reveal: Show the true situation
5. Recontextualization: Make everything make sense

KEY PRINCIPLES:
- The twist must be fair (clues should exist)
- It should change the story's meaning
- Avoid "it was all a dream" unless brilliantly executed
- Make the audience want to rewatch for clues
