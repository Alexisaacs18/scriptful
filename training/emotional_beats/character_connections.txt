Sarah and Detective Martinez sit across from each other.

SARAH
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

Because you trust me.

SARAH
(beat)
I don't trust anyone.

MARTINEZ
You're here, aren't you?

Sarah looks at him, really looks at him.

SARAH
You remind me of my father.

MARTINEZ
Is that a good thing?

SARAH
(thinking)
He was a good cop. A good man.
But he was scared of everything.

MARTINEZ
What was he scared of?

SARAH
Life. Love. Being happy.
He thought he didn't deserve it.

MARTINEZ
And you think you don't either.

SARAH
(quietly)
I don't know what I think anymore.

MARTINEZ
Sarah, you're not your father.

SARAH
How do you know?

MARTINEZ
Because you're here, trying to figure things out.
Your father ran away. You're facing them head on.

Sarah looks at him, tears in her eyes.

SARAH
Thank you.

MARTINEZ
For what?

For seeing me. Really seeing me.
