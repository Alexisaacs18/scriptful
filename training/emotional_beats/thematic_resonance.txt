Example Thematic Scene:
INT. ABANDONED CHURCH - NIGHT
Sarah stands in the empty sanctuary, looking at the altar.

SARAH
(voice over)
I used to believe in justice.
In right and wrong.
In good people and bad people.

She walks down the aisle, footsteps echoing.

SARAH
(voice over)
But life isn't that simple.
Good people do bad things.
Bad people have good reasons.

Sarah reaches the altar, touches the wood.

SARAH
(voice over)
My father was a good man.
But he left us. Abandoned us.
Does that make him bad?

She looks up at the cross above the altar.

SARAH
(voice over)
Or does it just make him human?
Scared. Confused. Overwhelmed.

Sarah turns, sees Detective Martinez in the doorway.

MARTINEZ
Sarah, we need to talk.

SARAH
(voice over)
Maybe that's what justice really is.
Not punishment or revenge.
But understanding.

SARAH
(voice over)
Understanding that we're all just people.
Trying to do our best.
Failing. Learning. Growing.
