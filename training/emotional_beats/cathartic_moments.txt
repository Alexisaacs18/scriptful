I've been angry for so long.
Angry that you left us.
Angry that you weren't there.

But I understand now.
You were scared. You were human.
And I was too young to see that.

Her father's eyes flutter open.

FATHER
(weakly)
Sarah?

(emotional)
Dad! I'm here. I'm right here.

I'm sorry... for everything.

I love you. That's all that matters.

I love you too, sweetheart.
