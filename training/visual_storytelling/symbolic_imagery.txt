Example Symbolic Scene:
INT. SARAH'S APARTMENT - MORNING
Sarah stands at her window, watching rain fall.

She reaches for her mother's old necklace on the dresser.

SARAH
(voice over)
Mom always said rain was nature's way of washing away the past.

Sarah puts on the necklace, looks at herself in the mirror.

SARAH
(voice over)
But some things... some things you can't wash away.

She opens her closet, sees her old police uniform hanging there.

SARAH
(voice over)
Like the uniform I haven't worn in three years.
Like the badge I turned in.

Sarah touches the uniform, then closes the closet door.

SARAH
(voice over)
Some things you have to face head on.

She walks to the door, opens it to reveal sunshine breaking through clouds.

SARAH
(voice over)
And some things... some things get better.

Common Symbolism Mistakes:
