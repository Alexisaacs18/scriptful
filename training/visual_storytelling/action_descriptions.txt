Example Action Scene:
INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
Sarah creeps through the dark space, her footsteps echoing off concrete walls.

Moonlight streams through broken windows, creating long shadows.

Sarah freezes. A sound. Metal scraping on metal.

She ducks behind a stack of crates, heart pounding.

A FIGURE emerges from the shadows - tall, hooded, carrying something.

Sarah's hand goes to her gun. She's not supposed to be here.
Not supposed to be armed.

The figure stops, listens. Sarah holds her breath.

A RAT scurries across the floor. The figure relaxes, continues walking.

Sarah exhales slowly, then follows.

The figure turns a corner. Sarah peers around--

--and sees him placing a package in a ventilation duct.

Sarah steps out from cover.

SARAH
Freeze. Police.

The figure spins, package dropping to the floor.

Sarah's gun is steady, but her hand trembles slightly.

FIGURE
(voice muffled)
You're not police.

SARAH
(steady)
I said freeze.

The figure reaches for something. Sarah's finger tightens on the trigger.

FIGURE
Don't do it.

Sarah's eyes flick to the package on the floor.

SARAH
What's in the package?

FIGURE
(beat)
Hope.
